Recall, that we built our analysis exclusively around the the 'vote' columns. In terms of history, country names and borders change (i.e., West Germany and East Germany), which is likely why we have more or a mismatch between voting counts in our analysis based on the 'vote' column and of the 'yes', 'no', and 'abstain' columns in the UN original dataset. As a result, we will only use the 'vote' column instead of using the 'yes', 'no', and 'abstain' columns. Moreover, we will continue to use the voting data created base on the 'vote' column. \n"]}]}
