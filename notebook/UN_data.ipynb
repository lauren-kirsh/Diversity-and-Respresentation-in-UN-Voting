However, that is not necessarily the case. For example, having a female candidate on the committee is different from having a candidate on the committee who is preferred by the female voters, and who themselves may or may not be female. Therefore, we should treat candidate attributes and voter attributes as two separate entities that need to be thought about when creating a fair committee. So, you guys designed a multi-election fairness model called the DiRe Committee Model that attempst to fix this problem. Essentially, diversity and representation are two separate things/goals. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O77ZsCJaB7iX"},"source":["**5) What is the need for candidate attributes and voter attributes in multiwinner elections?**\n","\n","I kind of stated the answer to this in the previous question, but we need to treat candidate attributes and voter attributes as two separate entities in multiwinner elections.
