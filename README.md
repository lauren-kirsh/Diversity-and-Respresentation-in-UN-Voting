# Diversity and Representation in UN Voting

## Background

This repository supports an ongoing lab research project at the Center for Data Science at New York University called "Assessing Diversity and Representation in the United Nations" that explores the intersection of Algorithmic Fairness and Computational Social Choice.

## About the Data

This repository uses the United Nations General Assembly voting data in 1946 to 2020 published by Erik Voeten (Georgetown University), Anton Strezhnev(Harvard University), and Michael Bailey (Georgetown University). The United Nations General Assembly voting data contains general information about each country, their UN membership, resolution, roll call, and vote. Particularly, we were interested in the "issue codes'' columns that categorize the resolutions and votes into six subjects. These are the issue code:

ME: Votes relating to the Palestinian conflict (19%)

NU: Votes relating to nuclear weapons and nuclear material (13%)

DI: Votes relating to arms control and disarmament (16%)

CO: Votes relating to colonialism (18%)

HR: Votes relating to human rights (17%)

EC: Votes relating to (economic) development (9%)


## Goal
The goal of this preliminary research was to develop a robust dataset with proxies for each issue code that will be used for further analysis regarding diversity and representation. As a result, the notebooks consists of merging external datasets with our main dataset. Additionally, we try to fill in some missing data in the original dataset with external datasets.
